          "biography": "Léonie Abo was born in Zaire in 1945, in Malungu on the banks of the Kwilu River. Her mother died in childbirth (hence the name 'Abo' given to the author, as it means 'mourning' in Bambunda). She was raised by Mabiungu, a young woman who could not have children. After a few years at primary school and a marriage arranged by her family, Léonie Abo found herself in the maquis alongside Pierre Mulele without having really had a say in the matter. In 1968, after the assassination of her husband, Léonie Abo fled to Congo-Brazzaville, where she has lived ever since (1996). She has two daughters: Eulalie (born in 1971) and Ghislaine (born in 1974).",
