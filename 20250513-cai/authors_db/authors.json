Her mother died in childbirth (hence the name 'Abo' given to the author, as it means 'mourning' in Bambunda). She was raised by Mabiungu, a young woman who could not have children. After a few years at primary school and a marriage arranged by her family, Léonie Abo found herself in the maquis alongside Pierre Mulele without having really had a say in the matter. In 1968, after the assassination of her husband, Léonie Abo fled to Congo-Brazzaville, where she has lived ever since (1996). She has two daughters: Eulalie (born in 1971) and Ghislaine (born in 1974).",
