# Congolese Author Index

**A free and accessible digital list of writers from Congo (DRC).**

## 📚 About the Project

The **Congolese Author Index** is a research and design project dedicated to documenting authors from the **Democratic Republic of Congo** along with their respective bibliographies.

Created out of personal need and cultural passion, this index aims to make it easier to discover, reference, and celebrate **Congolese literature**—without jumping across multiple websites or databases.

## 🎯 Who It's For

This resource is designed for **anyone with an interest in Congolese culture and literature**, especially:
- **Researchers & analysts**
- **Writers, artists, and creatives**
- **Educators & students**
- **Curious readers and cultural enthusiasts**

## ✊ Why This Exists

This project is more than a digital tool—it's an act of **design activism**. It was born from a desire to:
- Reduce barriers to accessing Congolese literary knowledge
- Celebrate and amplify Congolese voices
- Explore and apply principles of **informational design** that **empower users** with more control over how data is accessed and used

It's also a personal celebration of heritage and an opportunity to explore how design can inform, connect, and liberate.
