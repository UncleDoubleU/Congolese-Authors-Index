                         <p>This index was created to minimise the number of websites I have to find Congolese literature to reference in my work and enjoy in my free time.<br />

                              This project is aimed at anyone interested in the Congolese culture.  But prioritises the researchers and analysts, creatives who are seeking to reference Congolese literature for their work.</p>

                         <p>From a design perspective this project was the perfect opportunity to celebrate my heritage.<br />

                              It also allows me to implement what I am learning about design activism through creating informational design.<br />

                              It is also the right time to showcase what I am learning about design activism: the creation of informational design that gives away more control on how the information is used to the audience by incorporating features that will allow for more control to be passed on the users. </p>
